        "In this project, we will develop a question-answering system. Please note that **usage of the `STANDARD_NC8AS_T4_V3` GPU compute on Azure ML Studio is required to pass the local tests, starting from Question 2**. Similar to Project 6, however, you may find it useful to test your code on an external environment (your local computer or Google CoLab) to make sure there are no runtime errors first.\n",

        "## Some words of caution\n",
        "Based on past semesters, this has been the most difficult project in the course. You will be working with computationally heavy models, and the local test for each question may take from 3-10 minutes to run. In addition, Question 8 (Fine-tuning BERT) will take one hour to run. Given these challenges, we have tried to be as thorough as possible in the question descriptions. Please read them carefully --  **spending 5 minutes to double check the instructions can sometimes save you hours of debugging**. In addition, plan your implementation carefully before writing any code, and always start testing on small subsets of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "For long-running tasks, a great way to track your code's progress is through the `tqdm` library (see the [TQDM primer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/clouddatascience.blob.core.windows.net/primers/tqdm-primer/tqdm_primer.ipynb) for more details), which we have imported below. Whenever you use Pandas' `.apply` or `.map` method, replace them with `.progress_apply` and `.progress_map` to see the progress bar.\n",

        "Also make sure to monitor your Azure budget carefully; you will not be able to finish this project and the final exam if you run out of budget. Note that **your remaining budget is in the Education tab on Azure, not the Cost Monitoring tab**."

SQuAD was one of the first with a public leaderboard and thus was able to garner a large amount of research result and publicity towards itself. Questions in the dataset can be answered from the context that accompanies them, without requiring any domain-specific knowledge; thus they belong to the class of *single-hop* question answering problem.\n",

Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".\n",

However, one important caveat is that encoding the questions and context sentences with `sent_transformer` takes a lot longer (as much as 10 times longer) than with `tfidf_vectorizer`, because this encoding is actually the forward pass through a pre-trained neural network. To address this issue, we recommend the following outline for your implementation:\n",

        "While logistic regression on Sent2vec representation performs relatively well, it still relies on a *uni-directional* representation of words. In this setting, the same word is always mapped to the same vector, even though it may have different meanings in different contexts (e.g., the word `bank` in `bank account` is not the same as in `river bank`). The final model we will explore in this project, which also addresses the above issue, is called BERT (Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers). This is a language model that learns to predict the probability of a sequence of words. The reason for BERT's success is its large feedforward layers and its attention heads, giving it 110 million parameters for the base model and 340 million parameters for the large model. It has been trained on Wikipedia articles and the Book Corpus dataset, which contains text from over 10,000 books of different genres over the tasks of next sentence prediction (NSP) and masked language modeling (MLM). BERT represents the current state of the art in various NLP task, including question answering.\n",

        "Similar to how our `LogisticRegression` model expects a real-valued vector as input, BERT also has its own way of constructing the input. At a high level, we want to convert each input tuple\n",
        "```\n",
        "(question, context_paragraph, answer_start, answer_end)\n",
        "```\n",

        "```\n",
        "where `encoding` is a dictionary that maps three keywords -- `\"input_ids\"`, `\"token_type_ids\"`, `\"attention_mask\"` -- to their respective vector representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implement the class `SQuADTokenizer` that performs the above conversion using a pre-trained Bert tokenizer. In particular, the class constructor accepts a `BertTokenizer` instance and the maximum sequence size `max_length`, which are stored as instance variables. Then, the `__call__` function acccepts a batch of data and performs the following steps:\n",
        "1. Extract the questions, context paragraphs, answer start indexes, and answer end indexes from the batch.\n",
        "1. Input the questions and contexts to the tokenizer as separate lists, so that the tokenizer can append special tokens such as `[SEP]` that help BERT recognize different passages. You should also set the following parameters: `padding` to `\"longest\"`, `truncation` to `True`, `max_length` to the stored `max_len`, and `return_tensors` to `\"pt\"`.\n",
        "1. Convert the `answer_start` and `answer_end` character indices to the indices of the two tokens that correspond to these start and end characters. For example, let's say:\n",
        "```py\n",
        "question = \"Which pets does your son have?\"\n",
        "context_paragraph = \"My son loves pets. He has two cats and a dog.\"\n",

        "answer_start, answer_end = 26, 44 # answer = \"two cats and a dog\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "now you need to identify the token that corresponds to the character `context_paragraph[answer_start]`. This character is `t` and the corresponding token is `two`, which is at index `6` in `tokenized_context`. Similarly for `answer_end`, the character `context_paragraph[answer_end]` is `g`, and the corresponding token is `dog`, which is at index 10 in `tokenized_context`. In summary, you are converting\n",

        "1. Return the encoded data (output from calling the tokenizer on the input questions and context paragraphs in Step 2), as well as the list of token start indexes and the list of token end indexes.\n",

        "* The [Tokenizer page](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer.html) and the section about [using the tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/quicktour.html?highlight=max_length) on HuggingFace may be helpful.\n",
        "* To convert `(answer_start, answer_end)` to `(token_start, token_end)`, you can use the [.char_to_token](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer.html#transformers.BatchEncoding.char_to_token) method. Here the `batch_or_char_index` is the index of the current data point within the input batch, and `sequence_index` should be 1 because we are doing this conversion on the context paragraph, which is the second input string to the tokenizer. You need to specify both `batch_or_char_index` and `char_index` when calling `.char_to_token`.\n",
        "* Sometimes calling `.char_to_token` will return `None` because the tokens have been changed (e.g., due to lemmatization) from their original form in `context_paragraph`. A simple work-around is to also consider the token that corresponds to the next or previous character. If doing so still yields `None`, we will just set the token index as `max_len` as a last resort. More formally, you should assign `token_start` to the first element that is not `None` among the following four values:\n",
        "    * `char_to_token(char_index = answer_start, ...)`\n",
        "    * `char_to_token(char_index = answer_start+1, ...)`\n",

        "    * `max_len`\n",
        "* You will do a similar assignment for `token_end` as well.\n",
        "* After extracting `answer_starts` and `anwer_ends` from the batch, you should convert them to `LongTensor` so that they can be used in `char_to_token()`."

In a lukewarm review for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, describing Spectre as inconsistent and unable to capitalise on its potential. Kenneth Turan, reviewing the film for Los Angeles Times, concluded that Spectre \"comes off as exhausted and uninspired\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times panned the film as having \"nothing surprising\" and sacrificing its originality for the sake of box office returns. Forbes\\' Scott Mendelson also heavily criticised the film, denouncing Spectre as \"the worst 007 movie in 30 years\". Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly viewed Spectre as \"an overreaction to our current blockbuster moment\", aspiring \"to be a serialized sequel\" and proving \"itself as a Saga\". While noting that \"[n]othing that happens in Spectre holds up to even minor logical scrutiny\", he had \"come not to bury Spectre, but to weirdly praise it. Because the final act of the movie is so strange, so willfully obtuse, that it deserves extra attention.\" In a positive review Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing \"The 24th movie about the British MI6 agent with a license to kill is party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies\". Other positive reviews from Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle, gave it a perfect 100 score, stating: “One of the great satisfactions of Spectre is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone’s personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person.” Stephen Whitty from the New York Daily News, gave it an 80 grade, saying: “Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn’t leave a huge impression as this film’s “Bond girl,” perhaps it’s because we’ve already met — far too briefly — the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real “Bond woman” since Diana Rigg.” Richard Roeper from the Chicago Sun-Times, gave it a 75 grade. He stated: “This is the 24th Bond film and it ranks solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it’s still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way.” Michael Phillips over at the Chicago Tribune, gave it a 75 grade. He stated: “For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, “Spectre” works best when everyone’s on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes.” Guy Lodge from Variety, gave it a 70 score, stating: “What’s missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of “Skyfall,” as the film sustains its predecessor’s nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent.”'],\n",

        "* To carry out the forward pass, you can input the encoding elements (after convering them to datatype Long), along with `token_starts` and `token_ends`, to `model`. Calling `.loss` on the output of the forward pass will yield the loss value.\n",
