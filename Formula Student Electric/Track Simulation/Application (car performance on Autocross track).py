Below is an application to test the performance of the winged car vs non winged car with given specs on Autocross track of Formula 
Student competition. The Run on an ordinary computer might take up to 5 mins, for both smulations to be complete. 
UNLIKE the version provided through the .ipynp file version, this version is slower as it doesn't generate a brake charactaristic curve 
during the solution. UNLIKE .ipynb file version this version also doesn't calculate the perfect shifting rpm between different gears, 
and the shifting rpm is set to 12000 rpm @ max power.
